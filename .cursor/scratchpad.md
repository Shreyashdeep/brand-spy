# Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

This project, called "brand-spy," is a marketing analysis tool built using Mastra.ai technology. It's designed to perform competitive analysis for D2C (Direct-to-Consumer) brands. The tool can identify top competitors for a given brand and provide comprehensive marketing insights including competitive analysis, target audience segmentation, marketing strategy, and content recommendations.

The project is now being expanded to become a full-stack web application with:

- A Next.js frontend that provides a user-friendly interface for inputting brand names and viewing competitor analysis
- A Node.js backend API that interfaces with the Mastra.ai agent
- Neon DB (PostgreSQL) for persistent storage of analysis results
- Support for retrieving 5 competitors with detailed marketing insights for any input brand

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. **Marketing Data Collection**: The project uses external APIs (specifically SerpAPI) to gather real-world data about brands and competitors.

2. **AI Integration**: Leverages Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash model for generating marketing insights and competitive analysis.

3. **Storage Solution**: Currently uses LibSQL for data persistence via @mastra/libsql package, but will be migrated to Neon DB (PostgreSQL).

4. **Agent Architecture**: Implements a marketing strategist agent that can analyze brands and provide detailed marketing recommendations.

5. **Tool Integration**: Custom tools have been created for competitor analysis and marketing strategy generation.

6. **Full-Stack Architecture**: Need to design a cohesive architecture that separates the frontend, backend API, and AI agent components while ensuring efficient communication between them.

7. **Frontend Design**: Creating an intuitive, responsive UI/UX in Next.js that effectively displays complex marketing insights and competitor analysis data.

8. **API Development**: Building a robust Node.js API that handles requests from the frontend and communicates with the Mastra agent.

9. **Database Schema Design**: Developing an efficient database schema in Neon DB to store analysis results and user queries for future reference.

10. **Deployment Strategy**: Planning for containerization and deployment of the three-tier architecture.

   - Success Criteria: Frontend can send requests to backend and display actual results

8. **Implement Analysis Storage in Neon DB**:
   - Create data models for storing analysis results
   - Implement persistence logic in the backend
   - Add retrieval functionality for historical analyses
   - Success Criteria: Analysis results are stored in the database and can be retrieved

### Phase 3: Enhancement and Optimization

9. **Optimize Analysis Display**:

   - Implement visualization components for marketing insights
   - Add filtering and sorting capabilities for competitor data
   - Create exportable reports
   - Success Criteria: Marketing insights are presented in an easily digestible and visually appealing format

10. **Implement Caching and Performance Optimizations**:

    - Add caching layer for frequent analyses
    - Optimize database queries
    - Implement rate limiting for external API calls
    - Success Criteria: Response times are under 3 seconds for cached analyses and under 15 seconds for new analyses

11. **Add User Management (Optional)**:
    - Implement user registration and authentication
    - Add saved analyses feature
    - Create user dashboard
    - Success Criteria: Users can create accounts, save analyses, and view their history

### Phase 4: Testing and Deployment

12. **Comprehensive Testing**:

    - Unit testing for frontend components and backend services
    - Integration testing for the entire application flow
    - Performance testing under load
    - Success Criteria: 90%+ test coverage and successful end-to-end testing

13. **Deployment Setup**:

    - Configure deployment pipelines
    - Set up containerization with Docker
    - Deploy to cloud provider
    - Success Criteria: Application is accessible online with all features working

14. **Documentation and Knowledge Transfer**:
    - Create user documentation
    - Document API endpoints
    - Create technical documentation for future maintenance
    - Success Criteria: Comprehensive documentation available for users and developers

## Current Status / Progress Tracking

The project has made significant progress with the core infrastructure now in place. We have:

1. Set up the Next.js frontend project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
2. Implemented the frontend UI components for brand search, competitor display, and marketing insights
3. Created the Express.js backend API with TypeScript
4. Defined the database schema and models for Neon DB
5. Created controllers and routes for the brand analysis API
6. Implemented the service layer to integrate with the existing Mastra agent

Next steps include:

1. Setting up a Neon DB account and configuring the connection
2. Testing the Mastra agent integration with the backend
3. Connecting the frontend to the backend API
4. Implementing proper error handling and loading states
5. Testing the entire flow from brand name input to displaying results

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

1. **SerpAPI Integration**: The current implementation requires a SerpAPI key to be set as an environment variable (`SERPAPI_KEY`). This needs to be configured for proper functioning.

2. **Integration Testing**: Need to perform thorough testing with various brands across different industries to ensure consistency and accuracy of the marketing insights.

3. **Workflow Enhancement**: The current workflow needs to be adapted to work within the new full-stack architecture.

4. **Next.js Expertise**: May need assistance with optimizing Next.js for displaying complex marketing data visualization.

5. **Neon DB Schema Design**: The current schema design includes tables for competitors, marketing insights, brand analyses, and a join table for brand-competitor relationships. This should be reviewed for efficiency and scalability.

6. **Environment Variables**: Need to set up the `.env` files for both frontend and backend with proper configuration values.

## Lessons

1. The project uses several alpha versions of Mastra packages (like `@mastra/core: ^0.9.4-alpha.1`), which may have stability implications.

2. External API dependencies (SerpAPI) create a potential point of failure if the API is unavailable or changes its response format.

3. The GENERIC_WORDS array is quite extensive but important for filtering out noise when identifying competitor brands.

4. Both the codebase and dependencies are TypeScript-based, ensuring type safety throughout the project.

5. When transitioning a Mastra agent to a full-stack application, it's crucial to maintain the agent's functionality while adapting it to work within an API context.

6. Next.js and Express.js with TypeScript provide a solid foundation for full-stack JavaScript applications with good type safety.

7. Separating the frontend and backend into different directories helps maintain a clear project structure and separation of concerns.
